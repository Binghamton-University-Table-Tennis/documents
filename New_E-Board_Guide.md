# New E-Board Guide

Congrats on becoming an E-Board member for the Binghamton University Table Tennis Club! This guide is meant to provide you with tips for running the club.

## Tabling Events and Promoting the Club
- Reserve a spot at the fall semester club fair. A lot of new students are looking for clubs to join and it is a good time to show our presence on campus. You may have to come to campus a few days earlier.
- Another tabling opportunity is the open house for admitted students. This takes place in the spring semester.
- Look out for emails for other tabling opportunities.

## Tournaments

##### NCTTA

- Watch for emails from the NCTTA. 
- Emails may go to your emails listed in the constitution or to the official club email.
- Pay the entry fee on time or you will be charged extra. The deadline is typically in the middle of the fall semester.
- The fall and spring divisional tournaments require you to bring an eligibility form. All competing members must sign the form and the form must be stamped by the registrar. Regionals and Nationals do not require this form.

##### Travel

- Save all your receipts so you can get reimbursed when you return.
- If you plan to rent a car, do it at least one week in advance.
- Set up a meeting with the club sports director if you need help planning your budget. Come prepared with cost estimates.
- Before you can travel, you need to set up a time to pick up the travel binder at the East Gym. This binder contains emergency contact information and you must bring this binder to the tournament.


## Club Sports Director

- Watch for emails from the clubs sports director, Craig Dube. 
- He will send out important emails regarding club sports and required meetings. Always attend these meetings!
- If you have any questions regarding club sports policies or need any help, set up a meeting with the club sports director.


## Practices

- Take attendance at practices using the club website.
- Always show up before the scheduled practice time.
- Wait for enough people to show up before you begin setting up the tables.
- You are encouraged to reserve one table for drills/multi-ball training.
- Start packing up before the scheduled end of practice so people can leave on time.


## Social Media
- Take pictures and videos at tournaments!
- Add pictures and news articles to B-Engaged. Ask the club sports director on how to do this.
- Add a slideshow to the club website.
- Post videos to our YouTube channel.
- Post news/announcements on the Facebook page.


## E-Board Meetings
- You are encouraged to have meetings at least once a month to reflect on the current state of the club and discuss upcoming events.
