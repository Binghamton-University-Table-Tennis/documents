# New E-Board Guide

Congrats on becoming an E-Board member for the Binghamton University Table Tennis Club! This guide is meant to provide you with tips for running the club.

## Tabling Events and Promoting the Club
- Reserve a spot at the fall semester club fair. A lot of new students are looking for clubs to join and it is a good time to show our presence on campus. You may have to come to campus a few days earlier.
- Another tabling opportunity is the open house for admitted students. This takes place in the spring semester.
- Look out for emails for other tabling opportunities.

## Tournaments

##### NCTTA

- Watch for emails from the NCTTA. 
- NCTTA announcements may go to your email listed in the constitution or to the official club email.
- Pay the entry fee on time or you will be charged extra. If you set up a meeting, the club sports director can do this for you using the club budget. The deadline is typically early/mid fall semester.
- The fall and spring divisional tournaments require you to bring an eligibility form. All competing members must sign the form and the form must be stamped by the registrar. Regionals and Nationals do not require this form.

##### Travel

- Save all your receipts so you can get reimbursed when you return.
- If you plan to rent a car, reserve it at least one week in advance. Enterprise Rent-A-Car has good pricing (Be sure to ask for a discount equal to the Binghamton employee discount).
- Lodging can be expensive. For divisional tournaments, which are likely to be within a 2 hour driving distance, a day trip should suffice. For regionals and beyond, a hotel or apartment is most likely required.
- Set up a meeting with the club sports director if you need help planning your budget. Come prepared with cost estimates.
- Before you can travel, you need to set up a time to pick up the travel binder at the East Gym. This binder contains emergency contact information and you must bring this binder to the tournament.


## Club Sports Director

- Watch for emails from the clubs sports director. 
- The director will send out important emails regarding club sports and required meetings. Always attend these meetings!
- If you have any questions regarding club sports policies or need any help, set up a meeting with the director.


## Practices

##### First Practice in the Fall
- The club sports director needs to come to the first practice. The director will review Club Sports policies and allow you to officially hold practices for the entire academic year.

##### All Practices
- Take attendance at practices using the club website.
- Always show up before the scheduled practice time.
- Wait for enough people to show up before you begin setting up the tables.
- You are encouraged to reserve one table for drills/multi-ball training.
- Come up with a system to determine who gets to play next on a table, especially for the first few practices where you have many people waiting to play.
- Start packing up before the scheduled end of practice so people can leave on time.


## Social Media
- Take pictures and videos at tournaments!
- Add pictures and news articles to B-Engaged. Ask the club sports director on how to do this.
- Add a slideshow to the club website.
- Post videos to our YouTube channel.
- Post news/announcements on the Facebook page.
- Create a group on GroupMe as needed.


## E-Board Meetings
- You are encouraged to have meetings at least once a month to reflect on the current state of the club and discuss upcoming events.
